# JonesForth Learning & Annotations

This repository records my journey of learning Forth. I am using the legendary `jonesforth` as a base to understand how a stack-based language is implemented in x86 assembly.

## Project Goal
* **Clone & Study:** Started with `nornagon/jonesforth`.
* **Modify & Experiment:** I will gradually add my own comments, rename labels for clarity, and try to modify the core interpreter to test my understanding.

## Original Credits
This project is a fork/mirror of **Richard WM Jones's** excellent literate x86 assembly implementation of Forth.
